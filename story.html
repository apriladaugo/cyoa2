                    <p>The story is based on Goldilocks and the Three Bears and is set in Africa. <br><br>
                        <strong>Munachi</strong>, a young West -African boy, finds a mysterious hut while hunting in the forest. Hungry and exhausted, he decides to take a look inside and discovers three bowls of West African Jollof rice on the table,
                        which he eagerly tries. Noticing that they look different, he decides to eat from one of the plates of rice (one was too spicy, the other was not spicy at all, and the third is just perfect). <br> <br>He then proceeds to the living
                        room, where he tries to find the right stool to sit on. After he finds the stool that is just right for him, he proceeds to enjoy his delicious plate of Jollof rice. <br><br>Exhausted and with a stomach full of food, Muna decides
                        to take a nap. He enters the bedroom and tries to find the right bed out of three. Without much ado, He immediately falls asleep in one of the beds and wakes up to see a very angry family of honey badgers!
